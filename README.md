# To Do List

This is a to do list web app made for the Athena Awards.

#### Demo link: [placeholder]

### Features

* Pomodoro timer
* 5 different website themes
* Custom cursors matching selected website theme
* Confetti effect when users complete a task
* Text showing how many pomodoros are completed
* Text showing percentage of tasks completed.


### Why I made this project

I thought that making a to do list would be a great way to start learning backend with Node.JS and Express. I also love using to do lists, so this was a useful project to make for myself to use. 

### How I made my project

* Node.JS and Express for backend
* HTML and CSS for frontend
* MongoDB to store users' data after restarting the server
* W3Schools as a reference for front end
* The Athena Express YSWS website as a reference for back end 
* Google Fonts for my fonts

### What I struggled with

I struggled the most with incorporating MongoDB Atlas to my web app. I never did anything like that ever before, so it was challenging, especially with the errors from linking my account properly on here. But eventually, after googling for help, I got it!

### What I learned

I learned a lot on this project, such as  
* Concepts of basic backend programming with Node.js and Express
* Saving user data using MongoDB Atlas. 
* More advanced CSS such as importing fonts, using custom cursors, different css options, etc.
